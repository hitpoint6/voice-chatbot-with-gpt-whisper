# Voice Chatbot

This project builds a chatbot on a web user interface (UI) that can receive voice input and output voice. The UI for voice input is built with **Gradio**. The received voice is transcribed into text using OpenAI's **Whisper**, which is then processed by **GPT-3.5** to generate the text output. Finally, the output voice is generated using **ElevenLabs**.

## Installation
1. Add a config file with used API keys
2. Run the code
 ```python listener.py```
