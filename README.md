# Voice Chatbot

This code will build a Voice chatbot on a web UI that receives voice input, processed by large language models and outputs a voice. The voice input UI is built with **Gradio**. The voice is then saved and transcribed into text by OpenAI **whisper**. The text output is generated by **GPT-3.5** and the output voice is generated by **ElevenLabs**. 

## Installation
1. Add a config file with used API keys
2. Run the code
 ```python listener.py```
